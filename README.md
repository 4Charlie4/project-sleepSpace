# sleepSpace
Project 1

## Purpose
To create a functioning website that demonstrates the aspects of basic web development while fulfilling a need. Many high school and college students struggle with healthy sleep schedules and habits, so we created a pleasent interface for positive habit-forming.

## Future Development
In the future, we would like to polish the interface with a drag-and-drop order, animations, a custom title, a "check in" feature for "I would like to try this", gradient text (was cut for ease of initial design), and a scroll-through quiz for easy answer modifications. 

## Built With:
